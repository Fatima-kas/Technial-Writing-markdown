# How to Identify Specific Shapes 🧐

This documentation will guide you through identifying five basic geometric shapes: **Square**, **Circle**, **Triangle**, **Rectangle**, and **Rhombus**. If you're unfamiliar with these shapes, don’t worry! By focusing on a few distinct features of each shape, you’ll be able to identify them easily. ✨

## 1. Square 🟩

### Key Features:
- **Number of Sides:** 4
- **Side Lengths:** All four sides are **equal** in length. 🟩
- **Angles:** All four internal angles are **90 degrees**, meaning they are right angles. 🔲
- **Symmetry:** A square has **four lines of symmetry**, meaning you can fold it in four different ways and each half will match. 🔄

### How to Identify:
- Look for a shape with **four sides** that are **exactly the same length**.
- Check if each of the **four angles** is a **right angle (90 degrees)**.
- If it passes these checks, it's a **square**. ✅

## 2. Circle 🔵

### Key Features:
- **Number of Sides:** A circle has **no sides**. 🚫
- **Symmetry:** A circle is **perfectly symmetrical** in all directions. ♻️
- **Diameter:** The distance from the center of the circle to any point on the edge is always the **same**. This distance is called the **radius**. 📏

### How to Identify:
- Look for a shape that has no **corners** or **edges**.
- The shape should appear **perfectly round**.
- Any point on the edge of the shape is the **same distance from the center**.
- If it’s round and has no sides, it’s a **circle**. 🎯

## 3. Triangle 🔺

### Key Features:
- **Number of Sides:** 3 sides.
- **Angles:** The sum of the internal angles is always **180 degrees**. 📐
- **Types of Triangles:** There are different types of triangles based on side length (equilateral, isosceles, and scalene) and angle (acute, right, and obtuse). 🏔️

### How to Identify:
- Look for a shape with **three sides**.
- The corners (angles) will vary depending on the type of triangle, but the total will always add up to **180 degrees**.
- A triangle can have different angles or side lengths, but it will always have exactly **three straight edges**. ✂️

## 4. Rectangle ⬛

### Key Features:
- **Number of Sides:** 4 sides.
- **Side Lengths:** Opposite sides are **equal** in length, but adjacent sides may differ.
- **Angles:** All four internal angles are **90 degrees** (right angles). 🔲
- **Symmetry:** A rectangle has **two lines of symmetry**. 🔁

### How to Identify:
- Look for a shape with **four sides**.
- The **opposite sides** should be **equal** in length.
- If the angles are all **90 degrees**, it’s a **rectangle**.
- If only the opposite sides are equal, but adjacent sides differ, it’s not a square but a **rectangle**. 🚪

## 5. Rhombus 🔷

### Key Features:
- **Number of Sides:** 4 sides.
- **Side Lengths:** All four sides are **equal** in length, like a square.
- **Angles:** The internal angles are **not 90 degrees**. The opposite angles are equal, and the adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees). ↔️
- **Symmetry:** A rhombus has **two lines of symmetry** (diagonal symmetry). ✂️

### How to Identify:
- Look for a shape with **four equal sides**, but **not all angles will be right angles**.
- The opposite angles will be **equal**, and the adjacent angles will add up to **180 degrees**.
- If the shape looks like a **tilted square** (where the angles aren’t right angles), it is likely a **rhombus**. 🔄

## Summary of Key Identifiers

| **Shape**    | **Sides** | **Equal Sides**  | **Right Angles (90°)** | **Symmetry**        |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Square**   | 4         | Yes              | Yes                    | 4 lines of symmetry |
| **Circle**   | 0         | N/A              | N/A                    | Infinite symmetry   |
| **Triangle** | 3         | No               | Varies                 | 3 sides             |
| **Rectangle**| 4         | Opposite sides   | Yes                    | 2 lines of symmetry |
| **Rhombus**  | 4         | Yes              | No                     | 2 lines of symmetry |

By using these key features, you will be able to identify these five basic shapes and distinguish them from one another. Remember to focus on the number of sides, the equality of the sides, the angles, and the symmetry when determining each shape! 🎯
